    * Interface Queue<E>
â€¢	Type Parameters:
E - the type of elements held in this collection
All Superinterfaces:
Collection<E>, Iterable<E>
All Known Subinterfaces:
BlockingDeque<E>, BlockingQueue<E>, Deque<E>, TransferQueue<E>
public interface Queue<E>
extends Collection<E>
A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing.
* Besides basic Collection operations, queues provide additional insertion, extraction, and inspection operations.
* Each of these methods exists in two forms: one throws an exception if the operation fails,
* the other returns a special value (either null or false, depending on the operation).
*
* The latter form of the insert operation is designed specifically for use with capacity-restricted
* Queue implementations; in most implementations, insert operations cannot fail.
*
Queues typically, but do not necessarily, order elements in a FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner.
* Among the exceptions are priority queues, which order elements according to a supplied comparator,
* or the elements' natural ordering, and LIFO queues (or stacks) which order the elements LIFO (last-in-first-out).
* Whatever the ordering used, the head of the queue is that element which would be removed by a
* call to remove() or poll().
*
* In a FIFO queue, all new elements are inserted at the tail of the queue.
* Other kinds of queues may use different placement rules.
* Every Queue implementation must specify its ordering properties.
*
The Queue interface does not define the blocking queue methods,
* which are common in concurrent programming.
* These methods, which wait for elements to appear or for space to become available,
* are defined in the BlockingQueue interface, which extends this interface.
*
Queue implementations generally do not allow insertion of null elements,
* although some implementations, such as LinkedList, do not prohibit insertion of null.
* Even in the implementations that permit it, null should not be inserted into a Queue,
* as null is also used as a special return value by the poll method to indicate that the queue
* contains no elements.
*
Queue implementations generally do not define element-based versions of methods equals and
* hashCode but instead inherit the identity based versions from class Object,
* because element-based equality is not always well-defined for queues with the same elements
* but different ordering properties.
