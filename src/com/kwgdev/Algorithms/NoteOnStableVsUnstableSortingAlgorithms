Sorting Algorithms

**Note on Stable vs. Unstable sorting algorithms
A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear
in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input array to be sorted.
Some sorting algorithms are stable by nature like Insertion sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.
And some sorting algorithms are not, like Heap Sort, Quick Sort, etc.

***This difference can be a reason to choose a less optimal sorting algo***

Background: a "stable" sorting algorithm keeps the items with the same sorting key in order.
Suppose we have a list of 5-letter words:

peach
straw
apple
spork

If we sort the list by just the first letter of each word then a stable-sort would produce:

apple
peach
straw
spork

In an unstable sort algorithm, straw or spork may be interchanged,
but in a stable one, they stay in the same relative positions
(that is, since straw appears before spork in the input, it also appears before spork in the output).

You canâ€™t stack untable sorts and get the exact same results every time.
